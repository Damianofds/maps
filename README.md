Only few quick and dirty maps.

Custom data are hosted on a geoserver istance running on a 2core - 2GB - 40GB digital ocean droplet

##on the **master** branch

* **lightmap** folder holds a quick and dirty map browser supporting the basics mapping stuff (baselayers, overviews, wms, TMS, timeseries, getfeatureinfo) through a json config file
* **layout-drafts** folder holds some experiments for a slightly complex layout
